Linux-Server-Configuration-UDACITY

This is the fifth project for "Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree" on Udacity.

In this project, a Linux virtual machine needs to be configurated to support the Item Catalog website.

You can visit http://34.207.168.240/for the website deployed.

Tasks

Launch your Virtual Machine with your Udacity account
Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server
Create a new user named grader
Give the grader the permission to sudo
Update all currently installed packages
Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200
Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)

Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database
Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser.
